"""
A system for replicating local SQLite3 database state to remote storage.

Theory of Operation
===================

A function to wrap a ``sqlite3.Connection`` in a new type is provided.  This
new type provides facilities for accomplishing two goals:

* It (can someday) presents an expanded connection interface which includes
  the ability to switch the database into "replicated" mode.  This is an
  application-facing interface meant to be used when the application is ready
  to discharge its responsibilities in the replication process.

* It (can someday) expose the usual cursor interface wrapped around the usual
  cursor behavior combined with extra logic to record statements which change
  the underlying database (DDL and DML statements).  This recorded data then
  feeds into the above replication process once it is enabled.

An application's responsibilities in the replication process are to arrange
for remote storage of "snapshots" and "event streams".  See the
replication/recovery design document for details of these concepts.

Once replication has been enabled, the application (can someday be) informed
whenever the event stream changes (respecting database transactionality) and
data can be shipped to remote storage as desired.

It is essential to good replication performance that once replication is
enabled all database-modifying actions are captured in the event stream.  This
is the reason for providing a ``sqlite3.Connection``-like object for use by
application code rather than a separate side-car interface: it minimizes the
opportunities for database changes which are overlooked by this replication
system.
