    Return the minimum amount of time for which a newly granted lease will

    The actual lease duration is hard-coded in Tahoe-LAFS in many places.
    However, we have local configuration that tells us when to renew a lease.
    Since lease renewal discards any remaining time on a current lease and
    puts a new lease period in its place, starting from the time of the
    operation, the amount of time we effectively get from a lease is based on
    Tahoe-LAFS' hard-coded lease duration and our own lease renewal
    configuration.

    Since this function only promises to return the *minimum* time a client
    can expect a lease to last, we respond with a lease time shortened by our
    configuration.

    An excellent goal to pursue in the future would be to change the lease
    renewal behavior in Tahoe-LAFS so that we can control the length of leases
    and/or add to an existing lease instead of replacing it.  The former
    option would let us really configure lease durations.  The latter would
    let us stop worrying so much about what is lost by renewing a lease before
    the last second of its validity period.
